This document is my personal log. It shows/documents my journey with the immersive insiders team and my personal development.

Most important is not a lot of text, but very concentrated text that explains the **essence** of what I did/tried/learned/discovered!!!

## Week 1 2021-03-01

### âœ…My Tasks
- Create/search a phone/scanning image
    - Create a animation from it in Unity
- Learning about branching and git flow
    

### What I learned
- There is this website [TheNounProject](https://thenounproject.com/)
    - it offers a whole world of nice high quality icons
    - I should keep in mind to credit the author otherwise it is "stealing"

- Git
    - Git Workflow
        -  Use 'git status' to check for current status of files - it will highlight the modified files in red.
        - Use 'git add' to add the files which have to commited and pushed, add only the files theat were edited.
        - Use 'git commit -m "some text" ' to commit your changes, before commiting make sure to add a short note using -m " " ,note should mention what modification one has made
        - Use 'git push' to finally push it to your repo in the server.
    - If credentials of a git user already exit , it can be easly changed by 
        - Type  " git config --global --user " . Which will open the following screen
        ![](img/Git_Config_snipping.JPG) 
        - At the bottom you can see the path at which the config file is located 
        - Naviagte to that path, open the file and enter your git email.
        - Whola ! it's done !
