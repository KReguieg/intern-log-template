# ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€My Internship LogðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

This document is my personal log. It shows/documents my journey with the immersive insiders team and my personal development.

Most important is not a lot of text, but very concentrated text that explains the **essence** of what I did/tried/learned/discovered!!!

## Week 1 2021-03-01

### âœ…My Tasks
- Create/search a phone/scanning image
    - Create a animation from it in Unity
- Learning about branching and git flow

### What I learned
- There is this website [TheNounProject](https://thenounproject.com/)
    - it offers a whole world of nice high quality icons
    - I should keep in mind to credit the author otherwise it is "stealing"
