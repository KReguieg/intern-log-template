# ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€My Internship LogðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

This document is my personal log. It shows/documents my journey with the immersive insiders team and my personal development.

Most important is not a lot of text, but very concentrated text that explains the **essence** of what I did/tried/learned/discovered!!!

## Week 1 2021-03-01

### âœ…My Tasks
- Create/search a phone/scanning image
    - Create a animation from it in Unity
- Learning about branching and git flow
    

### ðŸ“šWhat I learned
- There is this website [TheNounProject](https://thenounproject.com/)
    - it offers a whole world of nice high quality icons
    - I should keep in mind to credit the author otherwise it is "stealing"

- Git
    - Git Workflow
        -  Use 'git status' to check for current status of files - it will highlight the modified files in red.
        - Use 'git add' to add the files which have to committed and pushed, add only the files that were edited.
        - Use 'git commit -m "some text" ' to commit your changes, before committing make sure to add a short note using -m " " ,note should mention what modification one has made
        - Use 'git push' to finally push it to your repo in the server.
    - If credentials of a git user already exit , it can be easily changed by 
        - Type  " git config --global --user " . Which will open the following screen
        ![](img/Git_Config_snipping.JPG) 
        - At the bottom you can see the path at which the config file is located 
        - Navigate to that path, open the file and enter your git email.
        - Whola ! it's done !

- Blender [Need to work on this in the future after getting my VR headset]
    - We can render blender models into VR Devices directly to see the preview.
    - Following are the simple steps as to how that feature can be enabled
        1. Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons
        2. Search for VR and â˜‘ check the box for "3D View: VR Scene Inspection"
        3. In 3D View , select View tab and choose your VR Camera
        4. In 3D View , select VR tab and click on Start VR Session

- Unity Programming
    - Learnt to use Invoke function 
        - I wanted to delay the start of my game by few seconds, I thought I could use coroutines and make the function to wait for few seconds, but that logic does not work , because in coroutines the function is already executed , it returns void.
        - After some researching I found out about *Invoke* Function, using this you can invoke a function after a certain time duration. This solved my problem. 
        - Syntax : Invoke("Function_name_in_form_of_staring", delay_duration)
    

- Programming Principles 
    - Learnt the S O L I D , principles 

### ðŸ› Created
- Tried with this image

    *author: Hand Phone by Jonathan Wnty from the Noun Project*


- But since my game required to hold the phone with both hands, I changed it to the below image ![](img/holding_smartphone.png)

This is how it looks after animation:
